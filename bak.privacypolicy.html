      <h2>Cookies and Other Web Trackers</h2>
      <p>Our websites and online resources also collect other basic information about you which may not directly identify you, but which may correspond with you or a particular device. We use some of this information to allow our websites to run, as well as to learn more about how our websites and online resources are used and to otherwise improve and administer the site. We also use this information to enable us to deliver information tailored to your interests and preferences, based on your use of the site. For example, we may collect the IP Address assigned to your computer by your internet service provider. This address may change each time you connect to the internet (a “dynamic” IP address), or it may remain the same (a “static” IP address). In most cases, this information is collected automatically, for our legitimate business interests. In some jurisdictions, we ask for your consent before collecting this information, in which case you will be presented with a choice as to whether you wish to allow the collection and use of this type of information. Please see our Cookie Notice for more information.</p>
      <p>Certain web browsers and other programs may be used to signal your preferences to Roche about how or whether Roche or third parties may collect information about your online activities. Currently, Roche does not respond to such signals.</p>

      <h2>Use of Data for Marketing</h2>
      <p>We do not sell or transfer your Personal Data to any non-affiliated entity for their own direct marketing use unless we provide clear notice to you and obtain your explicit consent. We use third party advertising companies to place ads on other websites. These companies may use data about your visits to this and other websites in order to measure advertising effectiveness and to provide advertisements about our goods and services that may be of interest to you. If you would like more information about this practice and your choices to opt out of having this information used by these companies, see our <a href="https://www.roche.com/ccpa-privacy-notice.htm" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Cookies Policy</a>.</p>
      
      <h2>Information Sharing / Recipients of Personal Data</h2>
      <p><strong>Recipients of your Personal Data</strong></p>
      <p>We may share your Personal Data with Roche’s affiliates around the world. Our Roche affiliates will use your Personal Data for the same purposes as we do. A list of Roche’s affiliates is available in the current annual report, which can be found in the Investors section of <a href="https://www.roche.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">www.roche.com</a>.</p>
      <p class="list-heading">We may also share your Personal Data with third parties, such as our service providers, for the following purposes:</p>

      <p><strong>International Transfers of Your Personal Data</strong></p>
      <p>Any Personal Data you provide to us through your use of this website may be transferred to or stored in a geographic region that imposes different privacy obligations than your country of origin. This means that your Personal Data may be sent to a country with less restrictive data protection laws than your own. Any such transfer will be conducted in compliance with applicable law.</p>
      <p>If your Personal Data is covered by the GDPR: For transfers of data within the Roche Group, contracts containing the EU Standard Contractual Clauses according to the EU Commission decisions of 27 December 2004 (2004/915/EC) and 05 February 2010 (C(2010)593) constitute appropriate and suitable safeguards to ensure compliance with GDPR. In addition to Standard Contractual Clauses, Roche may also use data processors that are certified under the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield, which establishes appropriate and suitable safeguards to ensure compliance with the GDPR according to the EU Commission decision of 12 July 2016 (C(2016) 4176).</p>
      
      <h2>Retention / Storage Period of Your Personal Data</h2>
      <p>The length of time in which we will store your Personal Data will differ depending on the purpose for which we have collected and are processing your data. In most cases, we will keep the data for three (3) years following our last interaction with you. We may, however, maintain your data for a longer period of time if we are required by law to maintain your data. For example, reports related to pharmacovigilance are kept for a minimum of 10 years after the withdrawal of the product in the last country where the product is marketed.</p>
